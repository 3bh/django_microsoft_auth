<!--
    Django Microsoft Auth uses OpenID Connect to authentication you. It is a
    rather involved and multi-step process. Anything small issue during the
    setup can cause something to break. As a result, I have a zero tolerance
    towards missing information for reporting bugs.

    Please be sure to read the fields and make sure you fill everything out
    the best you can. If your issue gets closed for missing information or
    being invalid, please feel free to re-open issue have to have made the
    requested changes.

<!-- Only the latest version is support. Sorry, but I do not have time to support older versions -->
* Django Microsoft Authentication Backend version:
<!-- Make sure you are using a support version of Django and Python -->
* Django version:
* Python version:
<!-- Your OS should not matter, but it does not hurt -->
* Operating System:
<!-- I only officially support Edge, Chrome, Firefox and other Chromium-based derivatives.

    I do not time or interest in support IE and I do not have the ability to support
    Safari as I do not have any Apple devices. Please feel free to make issues for IE
    and Safari and I can try to help troubleshoot and help you figure out what is wrong,
    but you are on your own to make a PR to fix the issue. I will accept any PRs to fix
    support for IE or Safari as long as they do not degrade the experience on the main
    browsers.

* Browser and version:
<!-- Browser extensions run extra Javascript on Web pages. As a result, I need
    to know what browser extensions you are using to help reproduce the issue
    on my end. I am not trying to shame you or say you cannot use a certain
    extension. I am a big fan of uBlock Origin, Privacy Badger, HTTPS
    Everywhere and all of those good privacy extensions.

* Browser extensions/plugins you have installed:

### Description

### Environment Setup Steps

<!-- This one is important! As I mentioned, OIDC is a complex flow. Any little
    thing can break it. I need to know what steps you took and EXACTLY what
    you did to do them so I can verify if there is an issue with your step up
    or if it an actual bug that needs to be solved.

    If it is an issue with your setup, I want to know why you had trouble and
    how I can update the docs to help people in the future.

    Give me command, give me snippets of code, everything related to how you
    set up your environment. What host you are using? Are you using nginx or
    another type of reverse proxy? Etc. Feel free to filter out an sensitive
    data or email me the details if you think it is necessary.

<!-- These are step by step instructions to reproduce your issue with your
    environment running and set up.
